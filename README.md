# xPlatformDotNet

We live in a bright new .NET world where the promise of “write once, run anywhere” is not restricted to just Java Applets but enabled by .NET Standard/Core and Xamarin tools. In this hands-on workshop we will have a short introduction to the terminology, some use cases and the available tooling before diving into creating an app that can run on iOS, Android or another platform. If time permits, we will then deploy a version of our .NET Standard code to a Linux box in Azure.
Come with your optimistic hat on, and make sure to do your homework so we don’t spend the whole session installing software.

Audience: Developers from both Java and .NET camps. Mac and PC friendly (You’ll need a Mac if you want to deploy to iOS)

This respository contains the material for a workshop to investigate and explore .NET Standard

# Prerequisites

## PC

See the Xamarin advice first
https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/requirements/

- Latest version of Visual Studio - https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/
- It might work with VS code but there will be a lot of messing about
- I suggest Community Edition at the very least

These are the features I think you should install

- Visual Studio core editor
- Universal Windows Platform development
- ASP.NET and web development
- Azure development
- Mobile development with .NET
- .NET Core cross-platform development

Extras that I have but might not be needed

- Android Studio (Which includes the Android SDK Manager)

## Mac
- Visual Studio For Mac - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/mac/
- XCode (from the app store or https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/)
- Android Studio [Optional - I think...]
